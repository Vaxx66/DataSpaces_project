Since the variance is an indicator of the spread of the data, is possible derive PCA as a dimensionality reduction algorithm that maximizes the variance in this lower-dimensional space.\n","Each dimension (or principal component) found by PCA is a linear combination of the d features.\n","The first principal component $Z_1$ is the normalized ($\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\phi_{j1}^2 = 1 $) linear combination of the orginal set of features $X_1, X_2,...,X_d$:\n","\n","$ Z_1 = \\phi_{11} X_1 +  \\phi_{21} X_2 + ... +  \\phi_{d1} X_d $\n","\n","that has the largest variance.\n","\n","$\\phi_{1} = (\\phi_{11}, \\phi_{21}, ..., \\phi_{d1})^T$ is the loading vector of the principal component and defines the direction in the feature space along which the data vary the most.\n","\n","Given an m x d dataset $X$, to find the first principal component loading vector we need to solve the following optimization problem:\n","\n","$\\underset{\\phi_{11}, ..., \\phi_{d1}}{maximize} \\ \\{ \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\ ( \\sum_{j=1}^d \\phi_{j1} x_{ij} )^2 \\} \\ subject \\ to \\ \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\phi_{j1}^2 = 1$ \n","\n","After the first principal component $Z_1$ is determined, the second principal component $Z_2$ is computed as the linear combination of $X_1, X_2,...,X_d$ that has the maximal variance out of all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with $Z_1$. Note that, constraining $Z_2$ to be uncorrelated with $Z_1$ is equivalent to constraining the direction of $\\phi_2$ to be orthogonal to the direction of $\\phi_1$.\n","Then, each subsequent PC computed is orthogonal to the previous ones and points in the direction of the largest variance of the residual subspace.\n","#### Projection perspective\n","PCA can be derived as an algorithm that directly minimizes the average reconstruction error.\n","This perspective allows to interpret PCA as a linear auto-encoder.\n","In detail, we found a compressed version $z$ of original data $x$ and then the compressed data can be reconstructed into $\\bar{x}$ which lives in the original dimensional space:\n","\n","![image](pca_reconstructed_err.png)\n","\n","The aim is to project (encoding) data onto a lower-dimensional space via an orthogonal linear mapping, while retaining as much information as possible, in such a way to minimize the distance between the original data and the reconstructed data (decoding).
